       Growing up, I would draw on my tests and scrap pieces of paper in my notebooks. I would let the pencil guide my eyes and when they would align I would realize I was creating art before my own eyes. I would aspire to be an artist but the stigma of the starving artist would scribble over my dreams. The days of drawing sprawling doodles on the walls of my childhood home with crayons have faded like a rainbow after the rain. Throughout my time in high school I would draw and started to push myself towards the pencils edge of my own pages but I could see myself drawing myself out of my own dreams. I would watch them from afar. I did not see the tireless hours I was spending drawing as work or something that could be a career. I just saw them as something I like to do.
 <p><br>
I now know that the work I was putting in, was me building a foundation for my creativity. As I entered my freshman year at college, I took some art courses as well as general education courses. I found that my passion for art was alive but I did not have a particular style of art work I focus on. I have taken an affinity to experimental design where I could blend both illustration and graphic design into one master piece.
  <p><br>
I love design, to me its akin to seeing the world in a whole new creative perspective. Everything around us has some aspect of design, whether is a layout of a magazine, a billboard advertisement or a simple candy wrapper. Being able to communicate an idea through visual art is a beautiful way to decorate every day life, and that to me is the reason why I design.
  <p><br>
I make my designs with attention to color and composition, pulling inspiration from ordinary life and translating what I see using digital media. The concept of my work is blended together and it’s evolving at a rapid rate. I use the internet and social media to view art from around the world. I like to view different color palettes, sometimes even viewing urban landscapes as refracting light provide different palettes to use color. I think that technology and art move at a breakneck pace but the constant strain is an expression of life.  
My aspiration to become a graphic designer stemmed from the volunteer work I had done for my high school’s events. Having the opportunity to create tickets and posters for a school dance, meeting or banquet exposed me to design, and working with clients. The awe I feel for art and design has now lead me to chase a living for it. 
  <p><br>
I want my art to make the viewer question the complexity of the subject and understand what I’m trying to communicate. Take what is real, break it down and somehow manage to make it seem like a science fiction object or something as detailed and interesting from a dream. That’s what I hope to get with an education at Parsons. I want my designs to evolve and for my art to be a piece of me; when someone see’s it they immediately recognize who made it.  Being exposed to other designers and living in New York, a cesspool of different cultures and ideas will ultimately mold my inspiration into something amazing. Design is my passion. I always want my designs to be me unvarnished, honest, and glowingly complex.
